# comp373_Observer
com.Observer Design Pattern Implementation

This implementation of the observer pattern was designed to help a post office notify people when their mail has arrived.
Though this implementation was based on a material post office and physical mail, the same observer pattern could just as easily be used to notify people of an email or other subscription.
